# The Perfect Lineup

## Instructions

In the initial commit to this project, you have been provided with files that contain a JavaScript module and some associated tests. Currently the `getPositionCounts` and `calculateTotalSalary` functions are not implemented causing some tests to fail. Use what we have learned about reducing to write a solution to the problem of calculating the total salary of a lineup.

## Provided Files

**.eslintrc.js** - a config file for eslint

**.gitignore** - this file sets the project up to ignore the node_modules folder when committing to git

**package.json** - this file sets up the Node project including all the dev dependencies

**lineup.js** - this file contains the functions for validating a fantasy baseball lineup

**tests.js** - this file contains tests for the functions in the `lineup` module

## Lineup Rules
1) The total salary of all players in a lineup may not exceed $45,000
2) Lineups may not contain more than 2 players from a single team
3) Lineups may not contain more than 3 players from a single game
4) Lineups must contain exactly 3 players with the position of 'OF' and must also contain exactly 1 player from each of the following positions: 'P', 'C', '1B', '2B', '3B', 'SS'
